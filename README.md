# minesweeper
Basic game of minesweeper implemented in android. Thumbtack coding challenge


From http://www.thumbtack.com/challenges/minesweeper

Design constraints

The board should be an 8x8 grid and by default 10 hidden mines are randomly placed into the board.
The interface should support these additional functions:
New Game: start a new, randomly generated game.
Validate: check that a user has correctly marked all the tiles and end the game in either victory or failure
Cheat: in any manner you deem appropriate, reveal the locations of the mines without ending the game.
